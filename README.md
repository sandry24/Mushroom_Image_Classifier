# Mushroom image classifier
 This project trains a model to classify a variety of mushrooms, dataset taken from Kaggle. The model has over 50% accuracy which is not a lot but the dataset is limited with over 215 mushroom classes. Theres a file that makes testing the model easy with some pre-loaded images but anyone can add their photos. (I can't attach the model because it's over 200MB).
